# Predictive Analytics for New England Groundfish Fishery Market Dynamics

## Story
The New England groundfish fishery has long been an iconic part of the region's cultural identity and economic livelihood. However, this fishery now faces increasing competition from imported whitefish species like cod and haddock from major producers in the Northeast Atlantic such as Norway, Iceland, and Scotland.
The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis evaluating the market dynamics and level of competition between the domestic New England groundfish fishery and imported whitefish over the last decades. We will also develop predictive models to forecast potential future trends in this fishery under different scenarios. We aim to quantify impacts on local fishermen, seafood suppliers, and consumers to ultimately inform policy recommendations supporting a sustainable local groundfish industry. 


## Approach
For centuries, the bounty of groundfish like cod and haddock from the waters off New England has been a way of life and economic engine for coastal communities in the region. However, this historic local fishery is now facing new competition from an influx of imported whitefish from nations like Northeast Atlantic countries.

To examine the extent and impacts of this foreign competition, we will undertake a comprehensive analysis evaluating the market dynamics between the domestic New England groundfish fishery and imported whitefish over the past 14 years. What factors are driving substitution between local and international supply? How have prices, catch volumes and market shares shifted over time? Most critically, what are the implications for New England's fishing families, seafood businesses and consumers?

### Using Economic Modeling to Forecast the Future
Our approach will fuse quantitative fisheries data with advanced economic modeling techniques like time series forecasting, regression analysis, price elasticity models and market share analysis. By combining catch statistics, trade flows, pricing data and other inputs into integrated supply and demand models, we can rigorously measure the competitive forces at play.

Leveraging insights from our historical analysis, we will develop predictive forecasting models to project how the New England fishery may evolve under different future scenarios - whether policy interventions, shifting consumer preferences, and market conditions.

These forward-looking simulations will quantify potential impacts years down the road, allowing stakeholders to proactively plan strategies to revitalize the domestic fishing industry for long-term sustainability. Uncertainty ranges around model predictions will be quantified using cross-validation and other techniques.

We consider external shocks or unanticipated events such as policy changes, economic shifts, or significant market disruptions in the historical datasets as the main source of possible risk that could dramatically alter the market landscape, making forecasts less reliable or relevant.

### Informing Policy to Protect a Regional Legacy

Synthesizing our findings, we will evaluate various policy options and management recommendations to help ensure a vibrant, competitive future for New England's iconic groundfish fishery in the face of intensifying foreign competition. Proposals may include strategies around resource access, supply controls, marketing, and more.

By uniting rigorous data-driven analysis with economic theory and industry perspectives, this project will provide an unprecedented quantitative look at the challenges and opportunities confronting one of New England's most culturally and economically vital marine resources. The interdisciplinary insights will inform evidence-based policies to protect the legacy of the domestic ground-fishery for generations to come.
